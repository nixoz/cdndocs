A digital certificate allows your website to exchange data securely over the Internet using the public key infrastructure (PKI). The certificate enables encryption of the communications between a website and its visitors.

# Certificate Types

CDN360 supports regular, subject alternative names (SAN) and wildcard certificates. In terms of publick key algorithm, it suports both RSA and ECDSA.

# Certificates Page 

Certificates are managed from the Certificates page. To display this page, click **Certificates** in the left pane. All certificates are versioned in CDN360. Once a version is saved, it cannot be changed. At anytime, only one version of each certificate can be deployed to the production and/or staging environment.
